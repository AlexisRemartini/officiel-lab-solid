SOLID principles examples
=========================

Import all the projects in eclipse and follow instructions in the wiki.

This repo is for students of GLO-4003 for now. Will be ported to github in an (hopefully) near future.

Note about the solutions
========================

These are possible solutions only, and not the only ones. Some are not even great: they fix the SOLID principle that was broken, but they could fix it better considering other architecture principles.

The LSP solution does not exist. It is just a straight out bad abstraction. While it is possible to think of another abstraction hierarchy, most of the solutions end up introducing other problems. It is not really possible to keep a single vehicle configurator (you could maybe get 2 configurators though).
